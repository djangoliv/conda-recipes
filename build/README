This directory contains files to set up Docker images that can be used to
build conda packages.

To build an image for 64-bit Linux, use:
sudo docker build -t conda linux-64

The mac-setup.sh script sets up a minimal conda environment on a real Mac (10.6)
system. It assumes the Mac has Homebrew installed, and so hides the Homebrew
packages to avoid contaminating the conda build environment. (Really we should
use a VM here, but they're a little more awkward to set up for Mac.)
