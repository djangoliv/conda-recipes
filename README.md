This repository contains inputs to build 'conda' packages for the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

The resulting packages are uploaded to [Anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org/salilab/) (formerly Binstar).

In the Sali lab we build these recipes using
`conda build --python=all recipename`. The Linux packages are built on our
CentOS 6 interactive nodes, and the Mac packages on our 10.6 system.
