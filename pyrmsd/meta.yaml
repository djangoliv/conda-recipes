  summary: "Efficiently calculate RMSDs for large structure sets"
  description: >
    pyRMSD is a small Python package that aims to offer an integrative
    and efficient way of performing RMSD calculations of large sets of
    structures. It is specially tuned to do fast collective RMSD
    calculations, as pairwise RMSD matrices.

    This package includes some minor bug fixes and Python 3 support
    from https://github.com/salilab/pyRMSD. Note that it does not currently
    include any CUDA calculators.

    See [the pyRMSD website](https://github.com/victor-gil-sepulveda/pyRMSD)
    and the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt402)
    for more details.

    If you have problems with this conda package, please
    [open an issue](https://github.com/salilab/conda-recipes/issues).
